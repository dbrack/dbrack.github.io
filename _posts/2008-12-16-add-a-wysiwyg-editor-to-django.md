I was looking for a WYSIWYG Editor that I can add to my Django Admin site, so editing content is even easier.
I found a great [article](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/AddWYSIWYGEditor "AddWYSIWYG") about that in the Django Wiki (they use TinyMCE). I followed the instructions and it worked out pretty well. You can even add smileys and images etc. Below you can see a Screenshot of TinyMCE running on my admin site.
