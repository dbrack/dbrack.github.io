In an [earlier post](/add-a-wysiwyg-editor-to-django/) I wrote about adding a WYSIWYG editor to Django's Admin interface.
As a fallow up, I'd like to share some thoughts about an interesting project I came across recently. It's called [django-grappelli](https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli) and is hosted on Google Code. It basically changes the whole look of the Django-Admin interface. Some people might not like that as they love the original look. I have to say, I like the original look too but I think django-grappelli just improves the interface dramatically! The look & feel is totally different. When I first used it, I really thought, whow, this is big. They even added a nice looking TinyMCE theme.

So I have to say, everything looks complete and consistent.
Anyway, enaugh teasing. Check out the screenshot below and make sure to visit the project site [here](https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli).
