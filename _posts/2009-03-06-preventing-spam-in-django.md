In the last couple of weeks I realized that my site got spammed with rather stupid comments. I really wanted to do something against it so I was looking for a solution that works with [Akismet](http://akismet.com/). [Patrick Beeson](http://patrickbeeson.com) has written a very good [article](http://patrickbeeson.com/blog/2009/feb/21/how-stop-spam-django-blog/) about how to use Akismet's Python API with Django's comment framework.
The only thing you have to do is to get an API Key for Akismet..but that's not really a problem. I can say it seems to be working pretty well!
So go and check it out [here](http://patrickbeeson.com/blog/2009/feb/21/how-stop-spam-django-blog/). It's worth it!
