Brack.io is the personal website of me, Dominik. I'm a passionate web developer based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I'm interested in JavaScript, TypeScript and other great web technologies.

I currently work at [FLYNT](http://www.flynt.io) where I focus on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) based projects.

Opinions provided on this website are my own.
